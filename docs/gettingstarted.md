# Getting Started



SPLayout aims to accelerate the layout design process in Silicon Photonics. Most of the operations are simplified by losing some flexibility compared with its dependency [gdspy](https://github.com/heitzmann/gdspy) . The basic thought of SPLayout is that the connection between two components should be quickly made according to the center points of thier ports. 



## First GDSII

Let's create a gdsii file with a basic waveguide.

```python
from splayout import *

# define cell 
cell = Cell("waveguide")
# define layer
wg_layer = Layer(1,0)

# start point and end point for the waveguide
wg_start_point = Point(0,0)
wg_end_point = wg_start_point + (10,0)
# make a waveguide
wg = Waveguide(wg_start_point,wg_end_point,width=0.5)
# draw the waveguide on the layout
wg.draw(cell,wg_layer)

# create file and save
make_gdsii_file("waveguide.gds")
```

Firstly, we create a cell named "waveguide". We define a waveguide from Point(0,0) to Point(10,0) with 0.5Î¼m width and draw it on the "1/0" layer. Finally, we generate the file "waveguide.gds" in the same folder with the python file.

We can check the gdsii file "waveguide.gds" with some gdsii editors such as [KLayout](https://klayout.de/).



## Components

These can be found in [example/basic.py](https://github.com/Hideousmon/SPLayout/blob/main/examples/basic.py) .

## Functions for Self-define Components

### AEMD Grating 

We can get a "Class" from the function "MAKE_AEMD_GRATING" that can be used to define an AEMD grating. More details can be found in "API Reference".

```python
# get a AEMD grating definition
AEMDgrating = MAKE_AEMD_GRATING(port_width=0.5)
# start point for the AEMD grating
grating_point = Point(90,-30)
# make the AEMD grating
right_grating = AEMDgrating(grating_point,RIGHT)
# draw the AEMD grating on the layout
right_grating.draw(cell)
```



![](_static/aemdgrating.png)



### Self-define Components

We can get a "Class" from the function "MAKE_COMPONENT" that can be used to define our own sub cell from another gdsii file. More details can be found in "API Reference".

```python
# take the "selfdefine.gds" as an example
SelfDefineComponent = MAKE_COMPONENT("selfdefine.gds")
# start point for the component
start_point = Point(0,-90)
# make the component
component = SelfDefineComponent(start_point,RIGHT)
# draw the component on the layout
component.draw(cell)
```

## Make File and Generate Specifical Layer

### make_gdsii_file

Make gdsii file based on all the drawn component before the function is called. It also can generate some specifical layers (like: cover layer, inverse layer).

```python
# create file and save
make_gdsii_file("basic.gds")
```

<img src="_static/basic.png" alt="basic" style="zoom:67%;" />



```python
# create file and save the layout with an inverse layer
make_gdsii_file("basic_inverse.gds",inv_source_layer=wg_layer,inv_target_layer=inv_layer)
```

<img src="_static/basic_inverse.png" alt="basic_inverse" style="zoom:67%;" />



```python
# create file and save the layout with inverse layer and cover layer
make_gdsii_file("basic_inverse_and_cover.gds",inv_source_layer=wg_layer,inv_target_layer=inv_layer,cover_source_layer=wg_layer,cover_target_layer=cover_layer)
```

<img src="_static/basic_inverse_and_cover.png" alt="basic_inverse_and_cover" style="zoom:67%;" />

## Interconnect Example

All the components have functions for returning their port points to simplify the interconnecting  operations.

```python
## first, a waveguide
waveguide = Waveguide(Point(0,-350),Point(10,-350),width=0.5)
waveguide.draw(cell,wg_layer)
## second, a double connector
doubleconnector = DoubleBendConnector(waveguide.get_end_point(),waveguide.get_end_point()+(10,-10),width=0.5)
doubleconnector.draw(cell,wg_layer)
## third, add grating at the end of the double connector
rightgrating = AEMDgrating(doubleconnector.get_end_point(),RIGHT)
rightgrating.draw(cell)
## fourth, add grating at the start of the waveguide
leftgrating = AEMDgrating(waveguide.get_start_point(), LEFT)
leftgrating.draw(cell)
```
